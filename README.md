 ``` sql
SELECT 
DATE_TRUNC(DATE(InvoiceDate), month) as month,
COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) as total_user,
ROUND(SUM(UnitPrice)/COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID),2) AS average_order_value
FROM
`my-data-analytics-385715.data_online_retail.online_retail_clean`

# Cohort Analysis

Monthly retention cohorts (the groups, or cohorts, can be defined based upon the date that a user purchased a product) and then how many of them (%) coming back for the following month in Jan-Dec 2011
